        Education has played a key role in shaping my path into the tech field. I am currently
        pursuing a Bachelor of Software Engineering with Multimedia at Limkokwing University of
        Creative Technology in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, where I am building a solid foundation in
        software development and modern computing concepts.
      </p>

        Through coursework and practical projects, I have been able to develop hands-on skills while
        gaining a deeper understanding of how technology is applied in real-world scenarios.
