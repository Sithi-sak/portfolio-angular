    <p>
      I'm a fourth-year Software Engineering student at Limkokwing University of Creative Technology
      with a passion for building web applications and exploring creative tech solutions. I enjoy
      working with JavaScript frameworks—especially Angular—and designing user-friendly interfaces
      with tools like Tailwind CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      While much of my work involves JavaScript, I'm deeply interested in languages such as C and Go
      for the performance and system-level insights they provide. I'm continuously learning and
      experimenting, often leveraging AI tools to prototype projects quickly and solve challenges
      efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond coding, I enjoy brainstorming design ideas and tackling problems that push both my
      technical and creative skills. My goal is to contribute to projects that are both practical
      and impactful for users.
